GO SEE THE FUNCTIONALITIES IN THE ASSESSMENT GRADING. everyone has different functionality.... You shld not overlap at all if it is "similar" add it to a different function() method.
this is show we actually did it. DO NOT merge functionalities (in the manual) meaning NO useing same function as another person. copy paste code fine but make your own function()

THIS IS THE SUPER DETAILED VERSION:

can someone from sequence go help class diagram? either shreya or melise 
sequence: 2 people (XK needs to be here since she did the coding)

design oo concepts + testing: 1 person (keep junit to the end we do the lab method first the old fashioned type in yourself and test yourself) Samiksha

**Things to note**

1. boundary: Restuarant App(MainApp Class)  inside class diagam in the manual
2. Entity: Class of objects + getter setter (eg. getTableCapacity())
3. Control: using the getter + setter for functions (eg. reservetable())
